## Design Patterns in Laravel

This repo does nothing but show using the DesignPatternsPHP (https://github.com/domnikl/DesignPatternsPHP)

The original repo doesn't show how to use these class as in they don't have a Client class which uses the pattern.

### How to Use

* Clone the repo
* Run `composer install`
* Run `php artisan serve` and go to http://localhost:8000
* Open the code in your favorite editor, open *app/routes.php* and start exploring.
